      <h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
      <p>
        Ravenclaw House is home to the wise, witty, and endlessly curious.
        With blue and bronze as its colours and an eagle as its emblem, 
        this house values individuality, eccentricity, and a passion for learning. 
        Led by Professor Filius Flitwick, Ravenclaws reside high in the Tower with breathtaking views, 
        perfect for minds full of ideas and invention. Known for producing many of the wizarding world’s 
        greatest innovators, Ravenclaw celebrates those who think differently, analyze deeply, 
        and never stop seeking knowledge.

      <h2>Slytherin</h2>
      <p>
       Slytherin House is often seen as dark and mysterious, but it is truly a home for the
       ambitious and the cunning. Marked by silver and green colours and the serpent emblem,
       its common room lies beneath the lake, adding to its allure. Led by Professor Severus
       Snape, Slytherins are clever, resourceful, and driven, often one step ahead of
       everyone else. Though often misunderstood, this house has produced legends like Merlin
       and continues to shape witches and wizards destined for greatness.

      <p>
      Gryffindor House is home to the brave and daring, symbolised by the lion and coloured in 
      scarlet and gold. Led by Professor McGonagall, its tower common room welcomes those with 
      courage, determination, and a fiery spirit. Gryffindors stand up for others, challenge 
      authority, and may act before they think—traits that shaped legends like Harry Potter and 
      Albus Dumbledore.

      <h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
      <p>
      Hufflepuff House is known for loyalty, hard work, and humility, symbolised by the badger 
      and marked with yellow and black. Led by Professor Pomona Sprout, its cozy common room lies 
      near the kitchens. Though often underestimated, Hufflepuffs are humble rather than boastful,
      and their strong morals, dedication, and loyalty make them true friends. It’s also the house
      with the fewest dark wizards—proof of its kind and steady nature.
